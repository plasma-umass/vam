This directory contains tools for gathering page-level reference
histograms (libmemtrace) and malloc traces (libmalloctrace). To
collect a memory trace, set the LD_PRELOAD variable to point to
libmemtrace.so; malloc tracing works the same way, but with
libmalloctrace.so.

Memtrace generates a file "memtrace.<pid>.<random>" after executing a
process. You can then process this trace file to generate LRU miss and
histograms with the lrusim2 utility.
